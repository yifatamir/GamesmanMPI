About GamesmanMPI
=================

GamesmanMPI is the brainchild of GamesCrafters, an undergraduate research group at UC Berkeley. GamesCrafters aims to solve abstract strategy games. GamesmanMPI uses distributed computing to solve games with gametrees too large to be solved on a single machine.
